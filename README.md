# COVID-19 Dashboard
A platform that is a one-stop source for tracking COVID numbers world-wide, tracking social media chatter, getting directed links to articles for specific topics and is a life-saver in terms of finding which store has basic home supplies in stock.
This was designed and developed using Express.js, React.js and Google BigQuery for data storage.
